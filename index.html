                            William Henry Gates was born on 28 October 1955, in Seattle, Washington. As the principal founder of Microsoft, Bill Gates is one of the most influential and richest people on the planet. Recent estimates of his wealth put it at US$84.2 billion (Jan. 2017); this is the equivalent of the combined GDP of several African economies. In recent years he has retired from working full time at Microsoft, and has instead concentrated on working with his charitable foundation “The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.”

                                <p>His father William Gates Sr was a senior lawyer, and his mother, Mary, served as an executive for a major bank. The family were wealthy but, remembering the challenges of the Great Depression, they encouraged their children to work hard and take nothing for granted.

                                    Aged 13, Gates attended the private Lakeside school. It was here that Gates had his first introduction to computers.<br>

Gates enjoyed the process of working with computers and arranged with a company Computer Center Corporation (CCC) to spend time on their computers – learning source code, such as Fortran, Machine Code and Lisp.

In 1973, Gates enrolled at Harvard, where he studied mathematics and computer science. However, Gates was more interested in pursuing his own coding, and when he saw an opportunity to found his own company, he dropped out of Harvard without finishing his course.

            <br>Bill Gates founded Microsoft in 1976 when he formed a contract with MITS (Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems) to develop a basic operating system for their new microcomputers. In the early days, Bill Gates would review every line of code. He was also involved in several aspects of Microsoft’s business such as packing and sending off orders.

The big break for Microsoft came in 1980 when IBM approached them for a new BASIC operating system for its new computers. In the early 1980s, IBM was by far the leading PC manufacturer. However, increasingly, there developed many IBM PC clones; (PCs produced by other companies compatible with IBM’s). Microsoft worked hard to sell its operating system to these other companies. Thus Microsoft was able to gain the dominant position of software manufacture just as the personal computer market started to boom. Since its early dominance, other companies have struggled to displace Microsoft as the dominant provider of computer operating software. Programs like Microsoft Word and Excel have become the industry standard.

                One area where Microsoft has never been successful is in the area of search engines. MSN live search has struggled to gain more than 5% of market share. In this respect, Microsoft has been dwarfed by Google. Nevertheless, the success of Microsoft in cornering various aspects of the software market has led to several anti-trust cases. In 1998 US v Microsoft, Microsoft came close to being broken up into three smaller firms. However, on appeal, Microsoft was able to survive as a single firm. Although Microsoft was the dominant computer firm of the 1980s, and 1990s, they are now seen as an ageing and declining company – compared to the more dynamic Google and Apple.

            ""In just 25 years since he first founded the company, Bill Gates has worked on building his two man operation with Paul Allen into a multi-billion dollar empire that has established Gates as one of the most influential men ever to impact our world.

Much of his success can be attributed not necessarily in creating completely new technology, but by innovating and leveraging existing technologies to adapt to the fast-paced nature of the technology sector.

As is often the case with brilliant minds, persistence is key, and Gates has been single-minded in his obsession over coding and technology since a young age. In his early days, his high school bought a very small computer terminal that was connected to the University of Washington’s mainframe.

At the time, unimaginable to us now, access to a computer was incredibly expensive and as a result, Gates and his friends spent up all the time their high school had bought for them.

Not to be deterred, Gates called the university to find out how he could get onto a terminal, even though he wasn’t a student. They eventually relented and gave him time from 3-6AM in the morning.

Far from an average teenage boy, he snuck out of his house every night to make the trek to the university, spent hours teaching himself to code, and then snuck back home before school, unbeknownst to his parents.

His love and obvious brilliance for technology and programming led Gates to attend Harvard in the fall of 1973. However, like many gifted students, he was quickly disinterested by the curriculum and his attendance dwindled.

In December of 1974, his classmate Peter Allen showed Gates a magazine article detailing the world’s first microcomputer. Seeing an opportunity, Gates and Allen cold called the manufacturer, MITS, in Albuquerque, and told the president they had written a version of the computer language BASIC for the Altair.

When he said he’d like to see it, Gates and Allen, who actually hadn’t written anything, created something out of thin air, working on alternative machines as the Altair was not available to them.

When Allen finally flew to meet the president to test the program, they had no idea whether or not it would actually work. But it did.  

Gates dropped out of Harvard and moved with Allen to Albuquerque, to officially establish Microsoft where they began not only writing software for MITS, but for other startups including Commodore, Tandy Corp and Apple- another great foresight.

1979 is when the pair hit it big time, moving to Seattle and striking a lucrative deal with IBM.""
